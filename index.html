            <p>I grew up in the Orlando area, but originally from a small town in northern Illinois. I am the youngest
                of four
                children. I love spending time with my family, especially my five nieces and nephews. I enjoy reading,
                traveling and doing crafts.</p>

            <p>I graduated from University of Central Florida in 2008 with a bachelorâ€™s in science for Health
                Information
                Management. I also completed my certification as a Registered Health Information Manager (RHIA) through
                America
                Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). I also recently completed my Certified Revenue Cycle
                Representative certification through Healthcare Financial Management Association (HFMA). I have worked
                at
                Orlando Health for sixteen years, and thirteen of those in Revenue Integrity. I am currently an
                Assistant
                Manager of Charge Management and Education.</p>

            <p>The foundation stones for a balanced success are honesty, character, integrity, faith, love and loyalty.
